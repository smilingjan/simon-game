# Simon React Game

This is a recreation of the 70's Simon Game - An electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. This continues until the user commits a mistake and ends the game.

## Why recreate this game?

I am going thru React courses and wanted to make sure I grasped what was being taught thru online medium and decided to recreate it in React.  Initially encountered this game from another online course using Javascript.  Used most of the UI from that course and added some functionalities like recalling the pattern every round and also having a timer and keeping a High Score for the session.  It seemed like a good challenge and yes - I learned a few new concepts along the way.

## Technologies
